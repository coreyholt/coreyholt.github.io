      <description>Meet ✨geom_valley✨ I started writing this script at the end of 2021, inspired by The Ringer series by Dmitri Cherniak and Thomas Lin Pedersen&amp;rsquo;s Constructive collection.&#xA;I was back home in sunny Wales and set about trying to use a series of random choices to produce a cartoon landscape. I make a lot of data visualisations in R and it occurred to me that I could use ggplot functions if I just consider components of the image in terms of points along two axes.</description>

      <description>Microbiomes: DADA2 I like to analyse all of my microbiome data directly in R with the DADA2 package. This is an Amplicon Sequence Variant (ASV) approach (meaning reads aren&#39;t clustered according to a similarity threshold) and relies on run-specific error models to denoise data and limit overestimations of sequence diversity. The DADA2 tutorial is a great place to start if you&#39;re interested in this method. Alternatively, you can implement DADA2 in QIIME2.</description>
