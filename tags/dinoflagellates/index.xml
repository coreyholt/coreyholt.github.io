      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;mtawali-m-cooney-ec-adams-j-jin-j-holt-cc-keeling-pk&#34;&gt;Mtawali M, Cooney EC, Adams J, Jin J, &lt;u&gt;Holt CC&lt;/u&gt;, Keeling PK.&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Dinoflagellates are an abundant and diverse group of protists that inhabit aquatic environments worldwide. They are characterized by numerous unique cellular and molecular traits, and have adapted to an unusually broad range of life strategies, including phototrophy, heterotrophy, parasitism, and all combinations of these. For most microbial groups, transitions from marine to freshwater environments are relatively rare, as changes in salinity are thought to lead to significant osmotic challenges that are difficult for the cell to overcome. Recent work has shown that dinoflagellates have overcome these challenges relatively often in evolutionary time, but because this is mostly based on single gene trees with low overall support, many of the relationships between freshwater and marine groups remain unresolved. Normally, phylogenomics could clarify such conclusions, but despite the recent surge in data, virtually no freshwater dinoflagellates have been characterized at the genome-wide level. Here, we generated 30 transcriptomes from cultures and single cells collected from freshwater environments to infer a robustly supported phylogenomic tree from 217 conserved genes, resolving at least seven transitions to freshwater in dinoflagellates. Mapping the distribution of ASVs from freshwater environmental samples onto this tree confirms these groups and identifies additional lineages where freshwater dinoflagellates likely remain unsampled. We also sampled two species of &lt;i&gt;Durinskia&lt;/i&gt;, a genus of “dinotoms” with both marine and freshwater lineages containing &lt;i&gt;Nitzschia&lt;/i&gt;-derived tertiary plastids. Ribosomal RNA phylogenies show that the host cells are closely related, but their endosymbionts are likely descended from two distantly-related freshwater &lt;i&gt;Nitzschia&lt;/i&gt; species that were acquired in parallel and relatively recently.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Investigation of heterotrophs reveals new insights in dinoflagellate evolution</title>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;cooney-ec-holt-cc-hehenberger-e-adams-ja-leander-bs-keeling-pj&#34;&gt;Cooney EC, &lt;u&gt;Holt CC&lt;/u&gt;, Hehenberger E, Adams JA, Leander BS, Keeling PJ.&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Dinoflagellates are diverse and ecologically important protists characterized by many morphological and molecular traits that set them apart from other eukaryotes. These features include, but are not limited to, massive genomes organized using bacterially-derived histone-like proteins (HLPs) and dinoflagellate viral nucleoproteins (DVNP) rather than histones, and a complex history of photobiology with many independent losses of photosynthesis, numerous cases of serial secondary and tertiary plastid gains, and the presence of horizontally acquired bacterial rhodopsins and type II RuBisCo. Elucidating how this all evolved depends on knowing the phylogenetic relationships between dinoflagellate lineages. Half of these species are heterotrophic, but existing molecular data is strongly biased toward the photosynthetic dinoflagellates due to their amenability to cultivation and prevalence in culture collections. These biases make it impossible to interpret the evolution of photosynthesis, but may also affect phylogenetic inferences that impact our understanding of character evolution. Here, we address this problem by isolating individual cells from the Salish Sea and using single cell, culture-free transcriptomics to expand molecular data for dinoflagellates to include 27 more heterotrophic taxa, resulting in a roughly balanced representation. Using these data, we performed a comprehensive search for proteins involved in chromatin packaging, plastid function, and photoactivity across all dinoflagellates. These searches reveal that 1) photosynthesis was lost at least 21 times, 2) two known types of HLP were horizontally acquired around the same time rather than sequentially as previously thought; 3) multiple rhodopsins are present across the dinoflagellates, acquired multiple times from different donors; 4) kleptoplastic species have nucleus-encoded genes for proteins targeted to their temporary plastids and they are derived from multiple lineages, and 5) warnowiids are the only heterotrophs that retain a whole photosystem, although some photosynthesis-related electron transport genes are widely retained in heterotrophs, likely as part of the iron-sulfur cluster pathway that persists in non-photosynthetic plastids.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Multiple parallel origins of parasitic Marine Alveolates</title>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;holt-cc-hehenberger-e-tikhonenkov-dv-jacko-reynolds-vkl-okamoto-n-cooney-ec-irwin-nat-keeling-pk-equal-contribution&#34;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Holt CC&lt;/u&gt;&lt;em&gt;, Hehenberger E&lt;/em&gt;, Tikhonenkov DV, Jacko-Reynolds VKL, Okamoto N, Cooney EC, Irwin NAT, Keeling PK. *Equal Contribution&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Microbial eukaryotes are important components of marine ecosystems, and the Marine Alveolates (MALVs) are consistently both abundant and diverse in global environmental sequencing surveys. MALVs are dinoflagellates that are thought to be parasites of other protists and animals, but the lack of data beyond ribosomal RNA gene sequences from all but a few described species means much of their biology and evolution remain unknown. Using single-cell transcriptomes from several MALVs and their free-living relatives, we show that MALVs evolved independently from two distinct, free-living ancestors and that their parasitism evolved in parallel. Phylogenomics shows one subgroup (MALV-II and -IV, or Syndiniales) is related to a novel lineage of free-living, eukaryovorous predators, the eleftherids, while the other (MALV-I, or Ichthyodinida) is related to the free-living predator Oxyrrhis and retains proteins targeted to a non-photosynthetic plastid. Reconstructing the evolution of photosynthesis, plastids, and parasitism in early-diverging dinoflagellates shows a number of parallels with the evolution of their apicomplexan sisters. In both groups, similar forms of parasitism evolved multiple times and photosynthesis was lost many times. By contrast, complete loss of the plastid organelle is infrequent and, when this does happen, leaves no residual genes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Photosystems in the eye-like organelles of heterotrophic warnowiid dinoflagellates</title>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;cooney-ec-holt-cc-jacko-reynolds-vk-leander-bs-keeling-pj&#34;&gt;Cooney EC, &lt;u&gt;Holt CC&lt;/u&gt;, Jacko-Reynolds VK, Leander BS, Keeling PJ.&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Warnowiid dinoflagellates contain a highly complex camera-eye-like structure called the ocelloid that is composed of different organelles resembling parts of metazoan eyes, including a modified plastid that serves as the retinal body. 1 The overall structure of the ocelloid has been investigated by microscopy; because warnowiids are not in culture and are rare in nature, we know little about their function. Here, we generate single-cell transcriptomes from 18 warnowiid cells collected directly from the marine environment representing all 4 known genera and 1 previously undescribed genus, as well as 8 cells from a related lineage, the polykrikoids. Phylogenomic analyses show that photosynthesis was independently lost twice in warnowiids. Interestingly, the non-photosynthetic taxa still express a variety of photosynthesis-related proteins. Nematodinium and Warnowia (known or suspected to be photosynthetic) unsurprisingly express a full complement of photosynthetic pathway components. However, non-photosynthetic genera with ocelloids were also found to express light-harvesting complexes, photosystem I, photosynthetic electron transport (PET), cytochrome b6f, and, in Erythropsidinium, plastid ATPase, representing all major complexes except photosystem II and the Calvin cycle. This suggests that the non-photosynthetic retinal body has retained a reduced but still substantial photosynthetic apparatus that perhaps functions using cyclic electron flow (CEF). This may support ATP synthesis in a reduced capacity, but it is also possible that the photosystem has been co-opted to function as a light-driven proton pump at the heart of the sensory mechanism within the complex architecture of ocelloids.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
