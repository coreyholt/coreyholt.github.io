      <title>Phylogenomic resolution of marine to freshwater dinoflagellate transitions</title>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;mtawali-m-cooney-ec-adams-j-jin-j-holt-cc-keeling-pk&#34;&gt;Mtawali M, Cooney EC, Adams J, Jin J, &lt;u&gt;Holt CC&lt;/u&gt;, Keeling PK.&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Dinoflagellates are an abundant and diverse group of protists that inhabit aquatic environments worldwide. They are characterized by numerous unique cellular and molecular traits, and have adapted to an unusually broad range of life strategies, including phototrophy, heterotrophy, parasitism, and all combinations of these. For most microbial groups, transitions from marine to freshwater environments are relatively rare, as changes in salinity are thought to lead to significant osmotic challenges that are difficult for the cell to overcome. Recent work has shown that dinoflagellates have overcome these challenges relatively often in evolutionary time, but because this is mostly based on single gene trees with low overall support, many of the relationships between freshwater and marine groups remain unresolved. Normally, phylogenomics could clarify such conclusions, but despite the recent surge in data, virtually no freshwater dinoflagellates have been characterized at the genome-wide level. Here, we generated 30 transcriptomes from cultures and single cells collected from freshwater environments to infer a robustly supported phylogenomic tree from 217 conserved genes, resolving at least seven transitions to freshwater in dinoflagellates. Mapping the distribution of ASVs from freshwater environmental samples onto this tree confirms these groups and identifies additional lineages where freshwater dinoflagellates likely remain unsampled. We also sampled two species of &lt;i&gt;Durinskia&lt;/i&gt;, a genus of “dinotoms” with both marine and freshwater lineages containing &lt;i&gt;Nitzschia&lt;/i&gt;-derived tertiary plastids. Ribosomal RNA phylogenies show that the host cells are closely related, but their endosymbionts are likely descended from two distantly-related freshwater &lt;i&gt;Nitzschia&lt;/i&gt; species that were acquired in parallel and relatively recently.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I make a lot of data visualisations in R and it occurred to me that I could use ggplot functions if I just consider components of the image in terms of points along two axes. I&amp;rsquo;d then add some leeway along those axes to include some variation during multiple iterations.&#xA;Admittedly, I haven&amp;rsquo;t worked on this in a good while but eventually I settled on the very messy R script I call &lt;i&gt;geom_valley&lt;/i&gt;. How does it work?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Beyond a handful of model or commercial species, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5850079/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;invertebrate microbiomes are vastly understudied&lt;/a&gt;. However, these animals, and these animal-microbe interactions in particular, are vital for ecosystem functioning.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Many people will be unfamiliar with the tiny invertebrates that support aquatic environments. Therefore, stressing the importance of these host-microbe interactions and their implications for wider environmental health can be challenging.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Artemia&lt;/em&gt;, or brine shrimp, are incredibly important for aquatic food production (thousands of tonnes are produced each year as feed for other animals) but are perhaps better known to some by another name: Sea-Monkeys.&#xA;Many of us have peered into Sea-Monkey tanks, willing our &amp;ldquo;instant pets&amp;rdquo; to finally hatch. Like a handful of other animals, brine shrimp can enter a period of suspended development, and this &amp;ldquo;diapause&amp;rdquo; is broken when the eggs are submerged in water. This means dehydrated eggs, which are remarkably stable, can be easily transported and reconstituted at a later date (be it in small, novelty tanks or otherwise).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;holt-cc-del-campo-j-keeling-pj&#34;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Holt CC&lt;/u&gt;, del Campo J, Keeling PJ.&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An embryonic diapause in unfavourable conditions has allowed brine shrimp to thrive in hypersaline environments and, unexpectedly, mail-order sachets and small, novelty tanks. Marketed as Sea-Monkeys®, each kit involves a 3-step process to generate adult Artemia within a matter of weeks. Whether these kits also allow for the maintenance of a host-associated microbiome is unclear. Therefore, comparing five replicate tanks under the same culture conditions, we sequenced the 16S ribosomal small subunit (SSU) gene to analyse bacterial community compositions in adults, their surrounding tank water, and their feed. Adult Sea-Monkeys® harboured a bacterial microbiome that was clearly distinguishable from the tank water and food. Furthermore, individual tanks had a notable effect on fine-scale microbiome variation. Several Sea-Monkey bacterial variants appeared absent in environmental samples and included genera (&lt;i&gt;Leucobacter&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Microbacterium&lt;/i&gt;) known to confer desiccation resistance in other hosts. Although Sea-Monkeys® taxonomy is unclear, phylogenetic inference of the cytochrome c oxidase I (COXI) gene from the host animal suggests Sea-Monkeys® belong to the Artemia franciscana ‘superspecies’. Overall, Sea-Monkeys® kits appear to be a convenient and scalable mesocosm for the study of host-microbiome interactions and could serve as a useful tool for future invertebrate microbiome research, outreach, and education.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This is an Amplicon Sequence Variant (ASV) approach (meaning reads aren&#39;t clustered according to a similarity threshold) and relies on run-specific error models to denoise data and limit overestimations of sequence diversity. The DADA2 tutorial is a great place to start if you&#39;re interested in this method. Alternatively, you can implement DADA2 in QIIME2. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Investigation of heterotrophs reveals new insights in dinoflagellate evolution</title>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;cooney-ec-holt-cc-hehenberger-e-adams-ja-leander-bs-keeling-pj&#34;&gt;Cooney EC, &lt;u&gt;Holt CC&lt;/u&gt;, Hehenberger E, Adams JA, Leander BS, Keeling PJ.&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Dinoflagellates are diverse and ecologically important protists characterized by many morphological and molecular traits that set them apart from other eukaryotes. These features include, but are not limited to, massive genomes organized using bacterially-derived histone-like proteins (HLPs) and dinoflagellate viral nucleoproteins (DVNP) rather than histones, and a complex history of photobiology with many independent losses of photosynthesis, numerous cases of serial secondary and tertiary plastid gains, and the presence of horizontally acquired bacterial rhodopsins and type II RuBisCo. Elucidating how this all evolved depends on knowing the phylogenetic relationships between dinoflagellate lineages. Half of these species are heterotrophic, but existing molecular data is strongly biased toward the photosynthetic dinoflagellates due to their amenability to cultivation and prevalence in culture collections. These biases make it impossible to interpret the evolution of photosynthesis, but may also affect phylogenetic inferences that impact our understanding of character evolution. Here, we address this problem by isolating individual cells from the Salish Sea and using single cell, culture-free transcriptomics to expand molecular data for dinoflagellates to include 27 more heterotrophic taxa, resulting in a roughly balanced representation. Using these data, we performed a comprehensive search for proteins involved in chromatin packaging, plastid function, and photoactivity across all dinoflagellates. These searches reveal that 1) photosynthesis was lost at least 21 times, 2) two known types of HLP were horizontally acquired around the same time rather than sequentially as previously thought; 3) multiple rhodopsins are present across the dinoflagellates, acquired multiple times from different donors; 4) kleptoplastic species have nucleus-encoded genes for proteins targeted to their temporary plastids and they are derived from multiple lineages, and 5) warnowiids are the only heterotrophs that retain a whole photosystem, although some photosynthesis-related electron transport genes are widely retained in heterotrophs, likely as part of the iron-sulfur cluster pathway that persists in non-photosynthetic plastids.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Coral-infecting parasites in cold marine ecosystems</title>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;trznadel-m-holt-cc-livingston-sj-kwong-wk-keeling-pk&#34;&gt;Trznadel M, &lt;u&gt;Holt CC&lt;/u&gt;, Livingston SJ, Kwong WK, Keeling PK.&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Coral reefs are a biodiversity hotspot and the association between coral and intracellular dinoflagellates is a model for endosymbiosis. Recently, corals and related anthozoans have also been found to harbor another kind of endosymbiont, apicomplexans called corallicolids. Apicomplexans are a diverse lineage of obligate intracellular parasites that include human pathogens such as the malaria parasite, Plasmodium. Global environmental sequencing shows corallicolids are tightly associated with tropical and subtropical reef environments where they infect diverse corals across a range of depths in many reef systems, and correlate with host mortality during bleaching events. All of this points to corallicolids being ecologically significant to coral reefs, but it is also possible they are even more widely distributed because most environmental sampling is biased against parasites that maintain a tight association with their hosts throughout their life cycle. We tested the global distribution of corallicolids using a more direct approach, by specifically targeting potential anthozoan host animals from cold/temperate marine waters outside the coral reef context. We found that corallicolids are in fact common in such hosts, in some cases at high frequency, and that they infect the same tissue as parasites from topical coral reefs. Parasite phylogeny suggests corallicolids move between hosts and habitats relatively frequently, but that biogeography is more conserved. Overall, these results greatly expand the range of corallicolids beyond coral reefs, suggesting they are globally distributed parasites of marine anthozoans, which also illustrates significant blind spots that result from strategies commonly used to sample microbial biodiversity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Multiple parallel origins of parasitic Marine Alveolates</title>

MALVs are dinoflagellates that are thought to be parasites of other protists and animals, but the lack of data beyond ribosomal RNA gene sequences from all but a few described species means much of their biology and evolution remain unknown. Using single-cell transcriptomes from several MALVs and their free-living relatives, we show that MALVs evolved independently from two distinct, free-living ancestors and that their parasitism evolved in parallel. Phylogenomics shows one subgroup (MALV-II and -IV, or Syndiniales) is related to a novel lineage of free-living, eukaryovorous predators, the eleftherids, while the other (MALV-I, or Ichthyodinida) is related to the free-living predator Oxyrrhis and retains proteins targeted to a non-photosynthetic plastid. Reconstructing the evolution of photosynthesis, plastids, and parasitism in early-diverging dinoflagellates shows a number of parallels with the evolution of their apicomplexan sisters. In both groups, similar forms of parasitism evolved multiple times and photosynthesis was lost many times. By contrast, complete loss of the plastid organelle is infrequent and, when this does happen, leaves no residual genes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Animals with these characteristics make promising candidate hosts for symbiotic bacteria, given the constant interactions with various bacterial colonizers, yet phoronids are one of the very few animal phyla with no available microbiome data whatsoever. Here, by sequencing the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene, we compare bacterial microbiomes in whole phoronids, including both tube and living tissues, with those associated exclusively to the isolated tube and/or the naked animal inside. We also compare these communities with those from the surrounding water. Phoronid microbiomes from specimens belonging to the same colony but collected a month apart were significantly different, and bacterial taxa previously reported in association with invertebrates and sediment were found to drive this difference. The microbiomes associated with the tubes are very similar in composition to those isolated from whole animals. However, just over half of bacteria found in whole specimens are also found both in tubes and naked specimens. In conclusion, phoronids harbour bacterial microbiomes that differ from those in the surrounding water, but the composition of those microbiomes is not stable and appears to change in the same colony over a relatively short time frame. Considering individual spatial/anatomical compartments, the phoronid tube contributes most to the whole-animal microbiome.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Photosystems in the eye-like organelles of heterotrophic warnowiid dinoflagellates</title>

Here, we generate single-cell transcriptomes from 18 warnowiid cells collected directly from the marine environment representing all 4 known genera and 1 previously undescribed genus, as well as 8 cells from a related lineage, the polykrikoids. Phylogenomic analyses show that photosynthesis was independently lost twice in warnowiids. Interestingly, the non-photosynthetic taxa still express a variety of photosynthesis-related proteins. Nematodinium and Warnowia (known or suspected to be photosynthetic) unsurprisingly express a full complement of photosynthetic pathway components. However, non-photosynthetic genera with ocelloids were also found to express light-harvesting complexes, photosystem I, photosynthetic electron transport (PET), cytochrome b6f, and, in Erythropsidinium, plastid ATPase, representing all major complexes except photosystem II and the Calvin cycle. This suggests that the non-photosynthetic retinal body has retained a reduced but still substantial photosynthetic apparatus that perhaps functions using cyclic electron flow (CEF). This may support ATP synthesis in a reduced capacity, but it is also possible that the photosystem has been co-opted to function as a light-driven proton pump at the heart of the sensory mechanism within the complex architecture of ocelloids.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

However, characterizations of invertebrate microbiomes are vastly outnumbered by those of vertebrates. Protists and fungi run the gamut of symbiosis, yet eukaryotic microbiome sequencing is rarely undertaken, with much of the focus on bacteria. To explore the importance of microscopic marine invertebrates as potential symbiont reservoirs, we used a phylogenetic-focused approach to analyze the host-associated eukaryotic microbiomes of 220 animal specimens spanning nine different animal phyla.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Results: Our data expanded the traditional host range of several microbial taxa and identified numerous undescribed lineages. A lack of comparable reference sequences resulted in several cryptic clades within the Apicomplexa and Ciliophora and emphasized the potential for microbial invertebrates to harbor novel protistan and fungal diversity.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Conclusions: Microscopic marine invertebrates, spanning a wide range of animal phyla, host various protist and fungal sequences and may therefore serve as a useful resource in the detection and characterization of undescribed symbioses.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Concerns over the availability and application of effective policies to deliver safe and sustainable future supply have the potential to hamper further development of the sector. Creating healthy systems must extend beyond the simple exclusion of disease agents to tackle the host, environmental, and human drivers of poor outcomes and build new policies that incorporate these broader drivers. Syndemic theory provides a potential framework for operationalizing this One Health approach.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

However, much of our knowledge about animal microbiomes comes from two deeply studied groups: vertebrates and arthropods. To understand interactions on a broader scale of diversity, we characterized the bacterial microbiomes of close to 1,000 microscopic marine invertebrates from 21 phyla, spanning most of the remaining tree of metazoans. Samples were collected from five temperate and tropical locations covering three marine habitats (sediment, water column and intertidal macroalgae) and bacterial microbiomes were characterized using 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing. Our data show that, despite their size, these animals harbour bacterial communities that differ from those in the surrounding environment. Distantly related but coexisting invertebrates tend to share many of the same bacteria, suggesting that guilds of microorganisms preferentially associated with animals, but not tied to any specific host lineage, are the main drivers of the ecological relationship. Host identity is a minor factor shaping these microbiomes, which do not show the same correlation with host phylogeny, or ‘phylosymbiosis’, observed in many large animals. Hence, the current debate on the varying strength of phylosymbiosis within selected lineages should be reframed to account for the possibility that such a pattern might be the exception rather than the rule.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Here we outline a risk schema for assessing potential impacts of chemical and microbial hazards on discrete subsectors of aquaculture—and control measures that may protect supply. As national governments develop strategies to achieve volumetric expansion in seafood production from aquaculture to meet increasing demand, we propose an urgent need for simultaneous focus on controlling those hazards that limit its production, harvesting, processing, trade and safe consumption. Policies aligning national and international water quality control measures for minimizing interaction with, and impact of, hazards on seafood supply will be critical as consumers increasingly rely on the aquaculture sector to supply safe, nutritious and healthy diets.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

High market prices and a relatively limited fishery suggests that the species may be a good candidate for aquaculture and/or further stock enhancement. Disease is one of the biggest threats to the development and progression of sustainable aquaculture. However very little is known in regard to diseases of the European lobster. Therefore, better characterisation of potential pathogens is vital to prevent collapse of any future culture initiative. The community of microorganisms within the gut, referred to as the gut microbiome, is involved in key metabolic processes affecting host health and fitness and may serve as a key resource in reducing susceptibility to pathogenesis. Here we utilise a series of histological and molecular techniques to better characterise lobster disease and the lobster gut microbiome and assess the use of sea-based container culture (SBCC) as a means to culture the species and overcome the bottlenecks associated with traditional land-based culture (LBC). In assessing mortality of land-based larvae and egg clutches entering the hatchery, we first detected the abalone parasite Haliphthoros milfordensis. Histological and molecular characterisation of this parasitic oomycete confirm past suspicions that H. milfordensis and Halocrusticida noduliformans are one and the same, highlighting the lack of available information surrounding animal oomycete pathogens. To facilitate monitoring of the parasite and growth of the literature, we developed and tested general oomycete primers, targeting the 18S ribosomal small sub-unit (SSU) and revealed a wealth of oomycete diversity in freshwater, marine water and soil samples. Monitoring health of deployed juveniles in SBCC, we observed histological signs of viral infection. Genome characterisation and phylogenetic reconstruction revealed the virus to be a new member of the Nudivirdae. Thus, we discovered the first described clawed-lobster virus: Homarus gammarus nudivirus (HgNV). The double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) virus, containing 107 063 bp contains the conserved repertoire of genes associated with the nudiviruses yet does not form occlusion bodies, characteristic of its neighbouring lineages. We compared viral prevalence in SBCC to LBC and questioned the transmission strategy of this novel virus in the absence of occlusion. Utilising high-throughput amplicon sequencing, we characterised the bacterial gut microbiome of the European lobster using the V4 region of the ribosomal SSU. We compared communities assembled in SBCC with those found LBC and assessed culture and time-dependent determinants of community structure and assembly. Typical of other aquatic invertebrates, the gut of juvenile European lobster mainly harboured Vibrio spp. but became more diverse as the host ages. Assessing phylogenetic structuring of the community, SBCC encouraged more deterministic assembly of the gut microbiome and reduced stochasticity observed in LBC. Furthermore, the gut microbiome of individuals reared in SBCC was significantly more diverse that those reared in LBC. A more diverse gut is thought to be beneficial to host health. In support of this theory, a reduction in bacterial gut diversity was associated with the detection of HgNV in the digestive tract, which was less prevalent in SBCC populations compared to the hatchery. Together, this information suggests that SBCC may support the culture of a healthy population through the assembly of a more beneficial gut community with the potential to provide resistance against infection.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Spatial and temporal axes impact ecology of the gut microbiome in juvenile European lobster (Homarus gammarus)</title>

To what extent environmental influences affect the differential distribution of these microbial populations may therefore significantly impact the successful farming of the host. Using a sea-based container culture (SBCC) system for the on-growing of European lobster (Homarus gammarus), we tracked the bacterial gut microbiota over a 1-year period. We compared these communities with lobsters of the same cohort, retained in a land-based culture (LBC) system to assess the effects of the culture environment on gut bacterial assemblage and describe the phylogenetic structure of the microbiota to compare deterministic and stochastic assembly across both environments. Bacterial gut communities from SBCCs were generally more phylogenetically clustered, and therefore deterministically assembled, compared to those reared in land-based systems. Lobsters in SBCCs displayed significantly more species-rich and species-diverse gut microbiota compared to those retained in LBC. A reduction in the bacterial diversity of the gut was also associated with higher infection prevalence of the enteric viral pathogen Homarus gammarus nudivirus (HgNV). SBCCs may therefore benefit the overall health of the host by promoting the assembly of a more diverse gut bacterial community and reducing the susceptibility to disease.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Here we describe the first naturally-occurring virus reported in any clawed lobster species. Hypertrophied nuclei with emarginated chromatin, characteristic histopathological lesions of DNA virus infection, were observed within the hepatopancreatic epithelial cells of juvenile European lobsters (Homarus gammarus). Transmission electron microscopy revealed infection with a bacilliform virus containing a rod shaped nucleocapsid enveloped in an elliptical membrane. Assembly of PCR-free shotgun metagenomic sequencing produced a circular genome of 107,063 bp containing 97 open reading frames, the majority of which share sequence similarity with a virus infecting the black tiger shrimp: Penaeus monodon nudivirus (PmNV). Multiple phylogenetic analyses confirm the new virus to be a novel member of the Nudiviridae: Homarus gammarus nudivirus (HgNV). Evidence of occlusion body formation, characteristic of PmNV and its closest relatives, was not observed, questioning the horizontal transmission strategy of HgNV outside of the host. We discuss the potential impacts of HgNV on juvenile lobster growth and mortality and present HgNV-specific primers to serve as a diagnostic tool for monitoring the virus in wild and farmed lobster stocks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The gut microbiome produces phenolic metabolites and increases their bioavailability. A handful of studies have suggested that polyphenol consumption alters gut microbiome composition. There are no data available investigating such effects in polyphenol-rich Montmorency cherry (MC) supplementation. A total of 28 participants (aged 40–60 years) were randomized to receive daily MC or glucose and energy-matched placebo supplementation for 4 wk. Faecal and blood samples were obtained at baseline and at 4 wk. There was no clear effect of supplementation on glucose handling (Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) and Gutt indices), although the Matsuda index decreased significantly in the MC group post-supplementation, reflecting an increase in serum insulin concentration. Contrastingly, placebo, but not MC supplementation induced a 6% increase in the Oral Glucose Insulin Sensitivity (OGIS) estimate of glucose clearance. Serum IL-6 and C reactive protein were unaltered by either supplement. The faecal bacterial microbiome was sequenced; species richness and diversity were unchanged by MC or placebo and no significant correlation existed between changes in Bacteroides and Faecalibacterium abundance and any index of insulin sensitivity. Therefore, 4 weeks of MC supplementation did not alter the gut microbiome, glycaemic control or systemic concentrations of IL-6 and CRP in a middle-aged population.&#xA;Keywords: polyphenol; Montmorency; cherry; microbiome&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Group-specific Oomycete primers were designed to amplify the 18S ribosomal small subunit (SSU), which initially identified the organism as the same as the ‘Haliphthoros’ sp. NJM 0034 strain (AB178865.1) previously isolated from abalone (imported from South Australia to Japan). However, in accordance with other published SSU-based phylogenies, the NJM 0034 isolate did not group with other known Haliphthoros species in our Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian phylogenies. Instead, the strain formed an orphan lineage, diverging before the separation of the Saprolegniales and Pythiales. Based upon 28S large subunit (LSU) phylogeny, our own isolate and the previously unidentified 0034 strain are both identical to the abalone pathogen Halioticida noduliformans. The genus shares morphological similarities with Haliphthoros and Halocrusticida and forms a clade with these in LSU phylogenies. Here, we confirm the first recorded occurrence of H. noduliformans in European lobsters and associate its presence with pathology of the egg mass, likely leading to reduced fecundity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
